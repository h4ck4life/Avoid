Avoid
=====

This is my first full fledged android game. Originally named "Avoid" in it's early stages (when it was only an idea).

It has now been labeled "Deflector" for it's market debut. 




GAMEPLAY
=====

The game is played by using dodge and survive, arcade-like tactics to move your orb and avoid the 'deflectors' and
various other objects that will damage you. The longer you can surivive, the more points you'll score, and the
farther you will progress into the harder phases of each level.
